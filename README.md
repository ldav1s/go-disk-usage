=============

Get disk usage information like how much space is available, free, and used.

## Documentation

Documentation can be found [here](https://godoc.org/github.com/ldav1s/go-disk-usage/du) and there is a
[short example](https://github.com/ldav1s/go-disk-usage/blob/master/duexample.go) of how to use this library.

## Compatibility

This works for Windows, MacOS, and Linux although there may some minor variability between what this library reports
and what you get from `df`.
